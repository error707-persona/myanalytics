I really liked the interview format that he used for tackling the problem so I figured I'd try SystemsExpert, which also uses that style. One of the things that I really got out of it was conveying confidence and using a very collaborative style while answering these questions. This tool was a big part of my successful interview prep and I'm very grateful to Clement and his team for creating this. Thanks guys!</textarea>

I can confidently say that AlgoExpert is one of the best resources out there for interview preparation, with fantastic video tutorials and an excellent question selection that allows you to get a deep understanding of the topics and confidence in your problem solving ability. The site is incredibly intuitive to use and I think that the staff are some of the best out there, being incredibly supportive and passionate about offering a great customer experience. I cannot recommend AlgoExpert highly enough.</textarea>

I had failed in so many interviews before, but I wanted to get into a top tech company so much that I even enrolled in a Master's program. Even then, I was unsure if I had what it takes to make it.

The format and content of the SystemsExpert videos is great. I applied the same format during my system design panels in my interviewers and did well. For me, getting used to asking a lot of questions during an interview was a skill I needed to learn and practice. AlgoExpert was a fun way to brush up on coding. The video explanations and sample solutions were very clear if I ever got stuck. I've been recommending this service to others and I can see how it will become even more valuable as the amount of content grows over time.</textarea>

Even when they asked questions I was not familiar with, I was able to break down the problem and write code which I learned from the explanations section on AlgoExpert. Being a Computer Science Engineering student, I had fundamental knowledge in Data Structures & Algorithms, but I didn't know how to approach, break down and apply this knowledge to solve problems. Also since all the problems are classified into categories, I was able to easily identify my weak points and work on those. Extremely grateful to AlgoExpert !</textarea>
